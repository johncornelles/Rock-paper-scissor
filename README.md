# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This interactive game challenges players against a strategic computer opponent in a classic Rock, Paper, Scissors battle.

## Description

The game allows players to select a difficulty level and make their choice among rock, paper, or scissors. The computer operates in two modes:

- **Normal Mode**: Computer randomly selects a choice.
- **Hard Mode**: Computer strategically counters the player's choice based on predefined rules.

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. Choose the difficulty level: either normal or hard.
3. Input your choice: rock, paper, or scissors.
4. The computer reveals its choice and determines the game outcome based on the rules.

## Rules
